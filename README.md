# Description of the included:
A screenshot of the audacity file containing all of the many audio files.
Recordings:
* Construction
* Two of a public bus to get sounds of it starting/stopping and it's doors opening/closing
* One including walking into Frick Park showing including a ccar driving by then the change in footstep sound to one on the gravel in the park.
* One in the park focused on the stream both while walking by it and while just standing by it.
* The rest are all focused on more walking or bird sounds.
Surprisingly, the ccars driving overhead weren't picked up in the recordings even when I tried to get my phone to so I will have to get some and add them in.

A very rough draft including most of the recordings. This just has the most imnportant aspeccts with very few if any cuts. So it has the cconstruction, the bus, and many nature sections.

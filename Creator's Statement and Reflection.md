# Creator's Statement and Reflection
The idea for my piece was to make the listener feel the difference between the city and natural spaces and include clear aspects of intrusion upon the natural. To do this correctly I felt it important to record all the audio I used myself, especially the natural sounds. I wanted these recordings so that I would be able to accurately capture the quiet that can be found in nature but very rarely in the city. I wanted to keep the audio as close to real life as possible unlike nature sound background noise videos, which play as many sounds at once as possible. Unfortunately, I did end up layering in some extra nature sounds at a few points. A cell phone is not the best at picking up far away sounds while moving, so I had to add in a few bird sounds here and there which I could hear on the walk but weren't audible in the recording. Another reason I went into the park to get the sounds myself was because in the park there is a large bridge that has frequent activity. I figured going there could get the idea of intrusion upon nature with cars driving by while still also hearing my feet crunch rocks and some birds potentially. But just like the birds, the cars driving overhead couldn’t be heard. However, unlike with the birds where I recorded birds while standing in case the walking was too loud, I didn’t of car sounds. So, I went to the sidewalk of Fifth Avenue, a major street on campus, to get the sounds of cars driving by. I also used the opportunity to get the sound of a bus slowing down to pick someone up and someone getting on. Surprisingly, the bus didn't make the loud sound of air that usually occurs when it stops so I had to take my recording of that from my recording of getting off the bus from days before. Once I had all of this finished up, I ran into the final major problem, the end did not get across the idea that the person on the walk leaves the park in the end because the footsteps just got quieter and weren't on gravel. While the footsteps started that way once getting off the bus it didn't last long enough for me to think the listener would get the connection. After a few minutes of trying to figure out a way to get the idea across I realized I already had an audio cue for the cityscape, machinery. And even better, I had a sound clip of a car driving by very loudly, so I made it a bit quieter to not blast the ears of the listener and put it during the shift in footstep sound as a motif to make clear that the city was once again around just like the beginning and with the intrusion with the bridge.
